# ToDo

MVP:

- [x] render floor plan
- [x] basic temperature sensors (always shown, single value)
- [x] temperature thresholds coloring
- [x] requesting HomeAssistant for actual data
- [x] CO2 sensors
- [x] window open/closed status 
- [x] support showing only one centered sensor per room when not enough space and actual positions of sensors with multiple values + multiple sensors when zoomed in
- [ ] rotated sensors
- [ ] window shades open/closed/percentage status
- [ ] wind speed and direction
- [ ] thermal color thresholds to be configurable

further development:

- [ ] window open + shades coupled with temperature highlights
- [ ] complex sensors (multiple values in same point)
- [ ] hightlight entire room if temperature is on special thresholds
- [ ] lux and UV sensors
- [ ] sun azimuth and elevation
- [ ] rain gauge
- [ ] link to graphs

later:

- [ ] heaters (deactivated/heating/heated + target temperature)
- [ ] smog sensors on floor
- [ ] smog sensors outside (e.g. on street) + other data from GIOÅš
- [ ] forecast with all details like cloud coverage
- [ ] sub-floors / dedicated rooms - e.g. 3D printer
- [ ] robot vacuum & humidifier pending tasks

even later:

- [ ] lights status
- [ ] power monitor
- [ ] fans and humidifiers
- [ ] moon status
